#Angular2_Boilerplate
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>My new Angular2 boilerplate. Of course I created it himself, many picked up from experienced programmers, but none of them no one asked for money, so I think I can leave it here like an open source boilerplate.
Added incremental build feature, for more details read the comments in the "gulpfile.js".</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
All you need is:

1: Clone repository
```
git clone 
```
2: Install npm packages
```
npm install
```
3: Start npm "liteserver" and gulp features
```
npm start
```
