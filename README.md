#noCloud - WeatherApp
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Angular2 web-application made by myself. Received an offer to perform a test to get a new job. It is a great experience for me in new, not previously known to me technologies. Let's see what I can do.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
- Angular2;
- TypeScript;
- Semantic-ui;
- SCSS;
- NPM;
- GULP.

<h3>Usage</h3>
All you need is:

1: Clone repository
```
git clone 
```
2: Install npm packages
```
npm install
```
3: Start npm "liteserver" and gulp features
```
npm start
```
<p>That's all! It's very simple to deploy it on your local machine, test and further develop.</p>
<p>It is an opensource project! Take it and modify like you want!</p>
